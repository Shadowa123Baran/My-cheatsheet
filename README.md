## My-cheatsheet
### Day 31. I am learning JavaScript, in this repository there are many different and interesting works collected by me during my learning.

### To make everything work, you need to enter the following commands into the terminal:
#### npm init -y
#### npm install -D @babel/core @babel-preset-env
### The command to show the result is:
#### jest
### Before that, you need to download node.js

#### Last update: 19.11.22

#### At the moment I am learning in detail inheritance in javascript.
